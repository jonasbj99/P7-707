Exercise10:
-   Prediction every 10 frames:
    -   Good with deadlift
    -   Too confident and usually always predicts something with high confidence
    -   Cant seem to predict squat start, might need nothing to avoid wronful predictions
-   Prediction every frame:
    -   Still struggles with squat start
    -   Less confidence in all predictions 
    -   Still good with deadlift predictions

Exercise30:
-   Prediciton every 30 frames:
    -   Pretty low confidence most of the time
    -   Slow and therefore skips exercise states
    -   Correct predicitons when slowing down repititions to follow the frame rate
-   Prediction every 10 frames:
    -   Fast enough to follow the reps
    -   Great with squat
    -   Lacks confidence with deadlift usually between 50% and 70% sometimes above, but still correct
-   Prediction every frame:
    -   Still struggles abit with deadlift confidence and slight tendency to predict contraction instead of the actual start position
    -   Still works well with squat

Exercise30n:
-   Prediction every 30 frames:
    -   Worked well, even the tempo seemed to match decently, and somehow felt better than every 30 frames with Exercise30
    -   Tends to predict deadlift-c with high confidence when doing nothing
-   Prediction every 10 frames:
    -   Works well
    -   Sometimes seems to predict squat contraction with low confidence when the movement is near squat start
-   Prediction every frame:
    -   Works well, but predictions seems to be delayed, probably because of the amount of computing being done
    -   Slight sideways to camera:
        -   Only model and framerate tested sideways
        -   Mediapipe struggled to track one arm at some angles
        -   Predictions still seemed to work
